I reused the template that was provided through Jasmine's repository. 
I used 4 graphs from https://blackwealthdata.org/
1. Degree Attainment by Race or Ethnicity
2. STEM vs. non-STEM Employment Rates Among 25-34 Year Olds with a STEM Degree
3. Percent Broadband Internet Subscription by Households, by Race/Ethnicity
4. High-Speed Broadband Internet Usage (25MBPS or higher)

I was also inspired by this story by The Pudding: https://pudding.cool/2024/03/teenagers/
